**"Girl Gamer"** 

 Among the most controversial and *ire-inspiring* terms for women who game.  


This is a forum for discussing women in geek culture and for women to relate experiences that occur as a result of their gender. We don't condone using one's gender and sex appeal to gain attention in place of merit.  

*...w-what about our subreddit name?* 

We seek to counter the [phenomenon](http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2004/03/19) stated by the [Greater Internet Fuckwad Theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_disinhibition_effect), and create a community of mutual respect and no harassment, so we can all have a pretty sweet time.

Or you know, just post some bad ass makeup tutorials inspired by video games. We like that stuff here!
